    The shoebill is distributed in freshwater swamps of central tropical Africa,
    from southern Sudan and South Sudan through parts of eastern Congo, Rwanda,
    Uganda, western Tanzania and northern Zambia. The species is most numerous
    in the West Nile sub-region and South Sudan (especially the Sudd, a main
    stronghold for the species); it is also significant in wetlands of Uganda
    and western Tanzania. More isolated records have been reported of shoebills
    in Kenya, the Central African Republic, northern Cameroon, south-western
    Ethiopia, Malawi. Vagrant strays to the Okavango Basin, Botswana and the
    upper Congo River have also been sighted. The distribution of this species
    seems to largely coincide with that of papyrus and lungfish. They are often
    found in areas of flood plain interspersed with undisturbed papyrus and
    reedbeds. When shoebill storks are in an area with deep water, a bed of
    floating vegetation is a requirement. They are also found where there is
    poorly oxygenated water. This causes the fish living in the water to surface
    for air more often, increasing the likelihood a shoebill stork will
    successfully capture it.[13] The shoebill is non-migratory with limited
    seasonal movements due to habitat changes, food availability and disturbance
    by humans.[12] Petroglyphs from Oued Djerat, eastern Algeria, show that the
    shoebill occurred during the Early Holocene much more to the north, in the
    wetlands that covered the present-day Sahara Desert at that time.[14] The
    shoebill occurs in extensive, dense freshwater marshes. Almost all wetlands
    that attract the species have undisturbed Cyperus papyrus and reed beds of
    Phragmites and Typha. Although their distribution largely seems to
    correspond with the distribution of papyrus in central Africa, the species
    seems to avoid pure papyrus swamps and is often attracted to areas with
    mixed vegetation. More rarely, the species has been seen foraging in rice
    fields and flooded plantations.[12]
